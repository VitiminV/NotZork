# NotZork
NotZork is an HP Lovecraft inspired text based adventure game I'm writing in order to get some experience in 
practical useage of OOP. Thus far all my school/personal projects have been very simple, one file full of 
functions problems, so I decided that I'd create this as a way of learning how things like packages, classes, 
methods, and inheritance work.

Most of the creative influence comes from the game "The Consuming Shadow" by Yahtzee; (http://store.steampowered.com/app/403830/)
and similar H.P. Lovecraft Cthulhean works. 

Most of the code originates from here: http://letstalkdata.com/2014/08/how-to-write-a-text-adventure-in-python/
I've been using this tutorial as a base, and am working on expanding functionality.

TODO:

-Player and monster stats

-weapons having variable damage based off stats, rather than a flat damage value

-random map generation

-more items

-more monsters

-boss battles

-A start screen where you can choose some options before starting a game.

WIP:

- Generating an ascii drawing of the map in console


RANDOM SCRIBBLING OF IDEAS:

-maybe draw simple backgrounds, and throw some .jpg's of enemies on screen.

-could add an attribute to monsters that references a .jpg and then draw that on screen over another .jpg which is the room.

-maybe an in console map editor

-maybe an in console character creator (custom stats. point buy system, rolls, I dunno yet)

-cheat commands
